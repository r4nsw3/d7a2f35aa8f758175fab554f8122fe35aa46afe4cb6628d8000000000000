  |   VOEZ is a colorful rhythm game filled with beautiful visuals.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   "VOEZ" is played by touching falling notes in time with the music.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Set in a fictional town named "Lan Kong Town", which is modeled       |
  |   after Yilan in Taiwan, the story is centered around 6 high school     |
  |   students who form a band that eventually achieves international       |
  |   fame.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Gameplay is simple, requiring players to touch vertically falling     |
  |   notes that have hit a bar on the bottom of the screen.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Depending on the song, the number of lanes for the notes increase     |
  |   and shift side to side, making the screen look as if it is dancing    |
  |   to the music.                                                         |
